Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Diego Galanti Gallardo and:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/) with focus on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99219186/191023133-a94f4e88-53e5-4de9-96e1-9f4c7e26d2b7.png" height="17">
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are: He/Him/His
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on: dggalanti@hotmail.com

I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development in 2013 and worked from 2008 to 2011 as Mobile Developer with Java(mainly J2ME but also J2SE). Most of my experience at the time was with Windows Mobile Edition, SymbianOS or Motorola M2M chips running Tiny Core Linux ðŸ˜„. I had some months of Android experience, remember that Android started to be used in Brazil in 2010 but only became big around 2012.

In 2011 I completely changed my career and worked for 10 years in IT consulting with a focus on Software Asset Management and Software licensing for big software providers like Microsoft, IBM, Dell and Adobe. If you need help with anything related to this subject feel free to get in touch ðŸ˜€.

In the end of 2021 I moved from SÃ£o Paulo to Berlin with my wife when she got a really nice job offer. Check on her github! https://github.com/AlineLee 

Since then I put a lot of effort on learning German ðŸ™ƒ and decided to go back to software developing (with a lot of catching up to do ðŸ˜…). I did the Berlin 42 Piscine (https://42berlin.de/), which was a great experience both to reconnect the software development wires inside my head and to meet super interesting people.
