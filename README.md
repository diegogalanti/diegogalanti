Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Diego Galanti Gallardo and:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/) with focus on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99219186/191023133-a94f4e88-53e5-4de9-96e1-9f4c7e26d2b7.png" height="17">
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/diegogalanti/TournamentTracker

I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development in 2013 and worked from 2008 to 2011 as Mobile Developer with Java(mainly J2ME but also J2SE). Implemented improvements and fixes on a mobile data collection app that was used by a range of customers: from big fashion events to governamental fiscalization departments.

I also worked on the design and implemented of the proof of concept app for the SAT system (https://portal.fazenda.sp.gov.br/servicos/sat), a embedded device that generates and authenticates Electronic Tax Coupons in the Sao Paulo State in Brazil. The app run on an embedded solution on M2M devices running Tiny Core Linux, included technologies as Java, REST APIs, XML parsing and RSA encryption and electronic signature.

In 2011 I completely changed my career and worked for 10 years in IT consulting with a focus on Software Asset Management and Software licensing for big software providers like Microsoft, IBM, Dell and Adobe. If you need help with anything related to this subject feel free to get in touch ðŸ˜€.

In the end of 2021 I moved from SÃ£o Paulo to Berlin with my wife when she got a really nice job offer. Check on her github! https://github.com/AlineLee 

Since then I put a lot of effort on learning German and also decided to go back to software developing (with a lot of catching up to do ðŸ˜…). I did the Berlin 42 Piscine (https://42berlin.de/), which was a great experience both to reconnect the software development wires inside my head and to meet super interesting people.
