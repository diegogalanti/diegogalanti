Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Diego Galanti Gallardo and:

- Iâ€™m a QA Engineer at Veeam Software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/) with focus on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99219186/191023133-a94f4e88-53e5-4de9-96e1-9f4c7e26d2b7.png" height="17">
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/diegogalanti/Minishell

I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development in 2013 and worked from 2008 to 2011 as Mobile Developer with Java(mainly J2ME but also J2SE). Implemented improvements and fixes on a mobile data collection app that was used by a range of customers: from big fashion events to governamental fiscalization departments.

I also worked on the design and implemented the proof of concept app for the SAT system (https://portal.fazenda.sp.gov.br/servicos/sat), a embedded device that generates and authenticates Electronic Tax Coupons in the Sao Paulo State in Brazil. The app run on an embedded solution on M2M devices running Tiny Core Linux, included technologies as Java, REST APIs, XML parsing and RSA encryption and electronic signature.

In 2011 I completely changed my career and worked for 10 years in IT consulting with a focus on Software Asset Management and Software licensing for big software providers like Microsoft, IBM, Dell and Adobe. If you need help with anything related to this subject feel free to get in touch ðŸ˜€.

In the end of 2021 I moved from SÃ£o Paulo to Berlin with my wife to pursue a career in tech.

Since then I put a lot of effort on learning German, Kotlin and QA topics. I also did the Berlin 42 Piscine (https://42berlin.de/), and am doing the 42 cursus too, what is a great way to learn new things and meet new people in Berlin.
